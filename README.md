# baristaMenu

As a partner at starbucks, one thing that I have always wanted to see was a training 
mode on our POS systems so that new baristas could get a test run of how to handle 
transactions before having to do so with real guests to help easy the stress of how
complex creating a drink order can be. These are the first stages of my efforts to 
recreate the interface.
