# baristaMenu

As a partner at starbucks, one thing that I have always wanted to see was a training 
mode on our POS systems so that new baristas could get a test run of how to handle 
transactions before having to do so with real guests to help easy the stress of how
complex creating a drink order can be. These are the first stages of my efforts to 
recreate the interface.


Not all functionality is completed such as changeing qauntiy of ingerdient amounts. 
The rest is very proper

##This Code is the Worst!
That being said, let me tell you why. My goal for creating this app was to use it for training new 
baristas but I designed the code this way you a tutorial series on converting a terrible designed code 
base over a code base up to industry standards and using a popular JS framework. Knockout will be my 
choice for this.
